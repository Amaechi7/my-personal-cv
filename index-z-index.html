    - The h2 has a z-index of 2.
    - The z-index property will only have an effect if the element's position value is not 'static' (the default). 
      That's why we've set its position to 'relative' here.
    - In the context of sibling elements (like the h2 and ul in our example), the one with the higher z-index will 
      appear on top if they overlap.

            <!-- Here's our ul element -->
            <ul style="background-color: darkgoldenrod; z-index: 3; position: relative;">

                <li>Python</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- 
    - The ul has a z-index of 3, which is higher than the h2's z-index of 2. 
    - This means that, if the h2 and ul overlap, the ul will appear above the h2.
    - However, note that z-index only affects the stacking order of elements that are on the same "stacking context". 
      This means that the z-index values are compared among sibling elements, and not between a parent and its children.
    - For example, even if a parent element has a very high z-index, its child elements can still be displayed beneath 
      other elements if those other elements have higher z-index values.
    - Importantly, child elements are always above their parent in the stacking order if they overlap, regardless of 
      z-index. This is because they exist within the stacking context established by their parent.
